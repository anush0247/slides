New Cloud based IT Infra with Central Identity.
==============================================

Introduction
------------
	To construct new Cloud based IT Infra with Central Identity.
	
Present System
--------------
	
	* Failed to maintain large user load web services like ONB, Exam servers,...
	* No proper Web Application Security & Standards.
	* No Central Identity, Storage & High Resource pool.
	* Inadequate Research requirements.
	* Dedicated computer cource labs. 

Proposed System
---------------

	* Cloud based hardware resources clustering.
	* Central Identity for all users to access Network based Applicaitons by providing well structured & documented API.
	* Dynamic user roles in Central Identity for extended application support.
	* New CPanel for Network Administration

		* Providing different user modes in OS, controlled remotely from CPanel.
		* Providing Virtual Labs (machines) with desired resource capabilities.
		* Providing a right to verify and approve user application requests.


Advantages
----------

	* Well structured & controllable Network Administraion
	* Efficient hardware utilization
	* No registration for new Network based applications through Central Identity API
	* Provding Virtual Machines with high hardware configuration for Researchers & Developers
